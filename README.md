**Metadata Application Profile for the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts Digital Collections**

This MAP documents different uses of digital collections metadata at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts. VMFA uses ArchivesSpace as the system of record for digitized materials from the archives and rare books collections, and data pulled from ArchivesSpace is published on VMFA's [Collections Site] (https://www.vmfa.museum/collections) and the [DPLA] (https://dp.la/search?partner=%22Digital%20Virginias%22&provider=%22Virginia%20Museum%20of%20Fine%20Arts%20Library%22&page=1) through the [Digital Virginias Service Hub] (https://digitalvirginias.org/).

This project was originally forked from the University of Houston Libraries Bayou City DAMS MAP as part of a class project for Chris Diaz' "Git and GitHub for Librarians" course offered by Library Juice Academy in January 2021.
